# Speakers

## Andrew Gelman

Andrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science and director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University. He has received the Outstanding Statistical Application award from the American Statistical Association, the award for best article published in the American Political Science Review, and the Council of Presidents of Statistical Societies award for outstanding contributions by a person under the age of 40.

Andrew has done research on a wide range of topics, including: why it is rational to vote; why campaign polls are so variable when elections are so predictable; why redistricting is good for democracy; reversals of death sentences; police stops in New York City, the statistical challenges of estimating small effects; the probability that your vote will be decisive; seats and votes in Congress; social network structure; arsenic in Bangladesh; radon in your basement; toxicology; medical imaging; and methods in surveys, experimental design, statistical inference, computation, and graphics.

## Heather Piwowar

Heather Piwowar is a cofounder of Impactstory and a leading researcher in research data availability and data reuse. She wrote one of the first papers measuring the [citation benefit of publicly available research data](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308), has studied [patterns in data archiving](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018657), [patterns of data reuse](https://peerj.com/preprints/1/), and the [impact of journal data sharing policies](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/journalpolicyproposal). She is a [frequent speaker](http://www.slideshare.net/hpiwowar) on research data archiving, writes a well-respected [research blog](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/), and is active on twitter (@researchremix).

## Jeff Spies

Jeff Spies the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the [Center for Open Science (COS)](http://cos.io/), a non-profit technology company missioned to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scholarly research. As CTO, Jeff is responsible for technical strategy, product vision, software architecture, external partner/funder development, and management of [COS Labs](http://github.com/cos-labs) — COS's research and development team. Jeff also co-leads [SHARE](http://share-research.org/) — an initiative by the Association of Research Libraries and COS to create a free, open dataset of research activity across the research life-cycle. Jeff has a Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology (read: Behavioral Statistics) from the University of Virginia, where he now holds a Visiting Assistant Professor position in the Department of Engineering and Society. Jeff's dissertation included the development of the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/) — a free, [open source](http://github.com/centerforopenscience) workflow management system and scholarly commons that is now the flagship product of COS.

## John Ioannidis

John P.A. Ioannidis currently holds the C.F. Rehnborg Chair in Disease Prevention at Stanford University and is Professor of Medicine and Director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center at Stanford University School of Medicine.  He has previously chaired the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece since 1999 (a tenured professor since 2003, on leave since 8/2010). Since 2008 he has been leading the Genetics/Genomics component of the Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and the Center for Genetic Epidemiology and Modeling (CGEM) of the Tufts Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts Medical Center. He is also adjunct professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health where he is teaching a course on evidence-based epidemiology and visiting professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Imperial College London. Dr. Ioannidis is a member of the executive board of the Human Genome Epidemiology Network, and has served as President of the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology, as a member of the editorial board of 26 leading international journals (including PLoS Medicine, Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, AIDS, International Journal of Epidemiology, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, Clinical Trials, Cancer Treatment Reviews, Open Medicine, and PLoS ONE, among others) and as Editor-in-Chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation. He has received several awards, including the European Award for Excellence in Clinical Science for 2007, and was inducted into the Association of American Physicians in 2009 and into the European Academy of Cancer Sciences in 2010. His 2005 paper in PLoS Medicine, “Why most Published Research Findings are False,” has been the most-downloaded article in the history of Public Library of Science and has been described by the Boston Globe as an instant cult classic. His work combines skills in clinical research methodology and evidence-based medicine with the challenges of current molecular medicine and genomics.

## Ellen Finnie

Ellen Finnie is Head, Scholarly Communications & Collections Strategy in the MIT Libraries.  
She leads the MIT Libraries’ scholarly communications and collections strategy in support of the Libraries’ and MIT’s objectives, including in particular efforts to influence models of scholarly publishing and communication in ways that increase the impact and reach of MIT’s research and scholarship and which promote open, sustainable publishing and access models.  She leads a team focused on outreach efforts to the MIT community in support of scholarly publication reform and open access activities at MIT, and oversees copyright support services, content licensing policy and negotiations, and innovating in using the collections budget and purchasing power as a lever for positive change in the scholarly communications ecosystem. Ellen also hosts therapy dog events in the Libraries!

## Joshua Hartshorne

Joshua is an assistant professor of psychology at Boston College Department of Psychology, where he directs the Language Learning Laboratory. His research focuses on understanding what allows humans, but not current machines, to learn language – and why it is that children, despite their salient limitations of both cognition and experience, are so much more successful at language learning than adults. He has a particular interest in applying new and emerging methods (such as computational modeling and crowdsourcing) to core problems in the language sciences.

## Leonie Mueck

Leonie studied chemistry at the University of Marburg and at St Petersburg State University specializing in computational chemistry. She undertook her doctoral work in Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Mainz, graduating in 2013.
