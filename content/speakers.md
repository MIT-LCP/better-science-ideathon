# Speakers

## Andrew Gelman

Andrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science and director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University. He has received the Outstanding Statistical Application award from the American Statistical Association, the award for best article published in the American Political Science Review, and the Council of Presidents of Statistical Societies award for outstanding contributions by a person under the age of 40.

Andrew has done research on a wide range of topics, including: why it is rational to vote; why campaign polls are so variable when elections are so predictable; why redistricting is good for democracy; reversals of death sentences; police stops in New York City, the statistical challenges of estimating small effects; the probability that your vote will be decisive; seats and votes in Congress; social network structure; arsenic in Bangladesh; radon in your basement; toxicology; medical imaging; and methods in surveys, experimental design, statistical inference, computation, and graphics.

## Heather Piwowar

Heather Piwowar is a cofounder of Impactstory and a leading researcher in research data availability and data reuse. She wrote one of the first papers measuring the [citation benefit of publicly available research data](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308), has studied [patterns in data archiving](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0018657), [patterns of data reuse](https://peerj.com/preprints/1/), and the [impact of journal data sharing policies](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/journalpolicyproposal). She is a [frequent speaker](http://www.slideshare.net/hpiwowar) on research data archiving, writes a well-respected [research blog](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/), and is active on twitter (@researchremix).

## Jeff Spies

Jeff Spies the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the [Center for Open Science (COS)](http://cos.io/), a non-profit technology company missioned to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scholarly research. As CTO, Jeff is responsible for technical strategy, product vision, software architecture, external partner/funder development, and management of [COS Labs](http://github.com/cos-labs) — COS's research and development team. Jeff also co-leads [SHARE](http://share-research.org/) — an initiative by the Association of Research Libraries and COS to create a free, open dataset of research activity across the research life-cycle. Jeff has a Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology (read: Behavioral Statistics) from the University of Virginia, where he now holds a Visiting Assistant Professor position in the Department of Engineering and Society. Jeff's dissertation included the development of the [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/) — a free, [open source](http://github.com/centerforopenscience) workflow management system and scholarly commons that is now the flagship product of COS.

## John Ioannidis

John P.A. Ioannidis, MD, DSc holds the C.F. Rehnborg Chair in Disease Prevention at Stanford University, where he is Professor of Medicine, Professor of Health Research and Policy, and Professor (by courtesy) of Biomedical Data Science at the School of Medicine, Professor (by courtesy) of Statistics at the School of Humanities and Sciences, co-Director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford, and Director of the PhD program in Epidemiology and Clinical Research. He has delivered ~500 invited and honorary lectures and he is the recipient of many awards (e.g. European Award for Excellence in Clinical Science [2007], Medal for Distinguished Service, Teachers College, Columbia University [2015], Chanchlani Global Health Award [2017]). He has been inducted in the Association of American Physicians (2009), the European Academy of Cancer Sciences (2010), the American Epidemiological Society (2015), and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (2015) and has served as President of the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology. He has received honorary titles from FORTH (2014) and Ioannina (2015), honorary doctorates from Erasmus U Rotterdam (2015) and U Athens (2017) and multiple honorary lectureships/visiting professorships (Caltech, Oxford, LSHTM, Yale, U Utah, UConn, UC Davis among others). The PLoS Medicine paper on “Why most published research findings are false” has been the most-accessed article in the history of Public Library of Science (with >2.5 million hits to-date) and has generated new directions for assessing scientific efficiency, reliability, and reproducibility. He is a Highly Cited Researcher according to Clarivate Analytics in both Clinical Medicine and in Social Sciences and among the 10 scientists with the highest current citation rate in the world (currently about 3,000 new citations are made to his work each month in the scientific literature according to Google Scholar).

## Ellen Finnie

Ellen Finnie is Head, Scholarly Communications & Collections Strategy in the MIT Libraries.  
She leads the MIT Libraries’ scholarly communications and collections strategy in support of the Libraries’ and MIT’s objectives, including in particular efforts to influence models of scholarly publishing and communication in ways that increase the impact and reach of MIT’s research and scholarship and which promote open, sustainable publishing and access models.  She leads a team focused on outreach efforts to the MIT community in support of scholarly publication reform and open access activities at MIT, and oversees copyright support services, content licensing policy and negotiations, and innovating in using the collections budget and purchasing power as a lever for positive change in the scholarly communications ecosystem. Ellen also hosts therapy dog events in the Libraries!

## Joshua Hartshorne

Joshua is an assistant professor of psychology at Boston College Department of Psychology, where he directs the Language Learning Laboratory. His research focuses on understanding what allows humans, but not current machines, to learn language – and why it is that children, despite their salient limitations of both cognition and experience, are so much more successful at language learning than adults. He has a particular interest in applying new and emerging methods (such as computational modeling and crowdsourcing) to core problems in the language sciences.
