# MIT Critical Data

MIT Critical Data is an affiliation of research labs at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who are engaged in research in and around "critical data", more specifically data that has a critical impact on human health.

## Leo Anthony Celi

Leo Anthony Celi MD has practiced medicine in three continents, giving him broad perspectives in healthcare delivery. As clinical research director and principal research scientist at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology (LCP), and as an attending physician at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), he brings together clinicians and data scientists to support research using data routinely collected in the process of care. He is one of the course directors for HST.936 – global health informatics to improve quality of care, and HST.953 – collaborative data science in medicine, both at MIT. He is an editor of the textbook for each course, both released under an open access license. The textbook "Secondary Analysis of Electronic Health Records" came out in October 2016 and was downloaded more the 100,000 times in the first year of publication. The massive open online course HST.936x "Global Health Informatics to Improve Quality of Care" was launched under edX in February 2017. Finally, Leo has spoken in 25 countries about the value of data in improving health outcomes.

## Alistair Johnson

Alistair Johnson is a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Alistair received his B.Eng in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at McMaster University, Canada, and subsequently read for a DPhil in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. Alistair's research interests focus around the reuse of routinely collected clinical data to improve healthcare, including topics such as: predicting the risk of mortality for intensive care unit patients, detecting physiologic deterioration for hospitalized patients, and identifying and characterizing septic patients. In addition, Alistair routinely co-organizes "datathons", weekend long events which aim to spark research on focused questions, form international collaborations, and generate new clinical knowledge.
