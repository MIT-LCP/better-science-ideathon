  Our objectives are four fold. (1) to develop projects to improve the research enterprise; (2) to connect isolated ongoing efforts; 
  (3) to engage social scientists, given the role that socio-political forces have played in molding today's research structure. 
  (4) to empower students – the future scientists – who are not yet entrenched in the current system to explore fresh ideas.
