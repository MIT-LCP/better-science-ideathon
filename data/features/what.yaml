description: "Our objectives four fold: (1) to form groups with the aim of developing initiatives to improve the research enterprise. (2) to draft a roadmap to connect isolated ongoing efforts, aiming to provide a clearer path forward.
(3) to bring social scientists into the movement given that socio-political forces have played a crucial role in molding the structure and practices of the biomedical research enterprise. (4) to engage students at all levels – the future scientists – who are not yet entrenched in the current system to brainstorm and explore fresh ideas. "
